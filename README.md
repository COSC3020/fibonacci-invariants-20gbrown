# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

# Answer

I think a good invariant would be that at the begining of each recursive call, the array 'resultArr' contains the Fibonacci sequence for the first'n' Fibonacci numbers, where 'n' is the input to the current recursive call. The reasoning for this would be the base cases and the recursive cases. When n is 0 or 1 the function returns [0] or [0,1], the two base cases show where the invariant holds true. When n is greater than or equal to 1, a recursive call is used to compute the Fibonacci sequence for n-1. After that is appeneded to the array, we can see the invariant holds true because resultArr still contains the first n numbers.
